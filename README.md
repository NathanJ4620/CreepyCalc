CreepyCalc
==========
This program was made for entertainment purposes.

I made this program after learning about the "relationship creepyness algorithm" I do not remember where I heard about it but It gave me an idea!
thus CreepyCalc was born!!

the equations works as follows

X = oldest age
y = minimum age that the oldest could date and it not be creepy

x/2 + 7 = y

if Y is higher than the other person's age then the relationship is creepy.

to do it in reverse (figure the oldest that the youngest could date without it being creepy) we simply make Y = youngest age and solve for X

y - 7 * 2 = x
